/*	 Events and delegates

- A good adition to the game would be understanting how to use delegates and events in C++.
- This taks is a research task and can be implemented using a different VS project.
- Create to classes: a listener and a dispatcher.
- The listener class has to be waiting for a method on the dispatcher to be called. I don't know the structure of it in C++,
	so I cannot explain it better. But you should look for "events in c++" "dispatcher event c++" to start.
